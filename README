This is the code that I and @jodrell wrote at the Pachube internet of things hackday.

Somehow, it worked well enough for us to demo. It might not work well enough for you to use.

There's an android PhoneGap app in app, and a sinatra ruby webapp in site. There's also some Arduino code that's yet to appear.
